1) First commit. Experiencing problems with Webpack-CLI (webpack) command won't run
- No Xcode or CLT version detected! - https://github.com/schnerd/d3-scale-cluster/issues/7
But at the same time: xcode-select: error: command line tools are already installed, use "Software Update" to install updates
- https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#on-macos
Trying to install X Code now. I guess that's it for today
